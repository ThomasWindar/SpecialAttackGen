# Game Special Attack Generator

This was a Codecademy project for a random word generator. 
The requirements were as follows:
- Build a message generator program using Javascript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer (used VScode)
- Message should use at least 3 random words

## Project Plan

Since this was supposed to be a Portfolio project and was open-ended, I decided on a Special Attack Generator for Game characters. The program would do the following:
- Greet the user and state its name and purpose. [DONE]
- Ask the user for a Weapon. [DONE]
- Create a name for the attack out of a set of words. [DONE]
- Choose the Base Damage of the attack at random.
- Determine based on semi-random values the scaling, cooldown, attack duration and number of hits, in order to balance the attack.
- Grant the attack a random special effect. 
- Afterwards showcase a basic enemy HP pool and print out the Special Attack in detail to the user. 
- Ask for another weapon input (restarts the process)

This would in practice generate the new attack.
